    "text": "I always find it amazing how many people seem to fail to use current LLMs to the fullest, even though they apparently work with them in research settings. This benchmark pipeline simply calls the OpenAI API and then painstakingly tries to parse the raw text output into a structured json format, when in reality the OpenAI API has supported structured outputs for ages now. That already ensures your model generates schema compliant output without hallucinating keys at the inference level. Today all the major providers support this feature either directly or at least indirectly via function calling. And if you run open models, you can literally write arbitrary schema (i.e. not limited to json behind the scenes) adhering inference engines yourself with rather manageable effort. I&#x27;m constantly using this in my daily work and I&#x27;m always baffled when people tell me about their hallucination problems, because so many of them can be fixed trivially these days.",

The “oversight” this introduces is in the ability to literally read the logical statement being evaluated to an answer, and running the solver to see if it holds or not.<p>The natural source of doubt is: who’s going to read a bunch of SMT rules manually and be able to accurately double-check them against real-world understanding? Who double checks the constants? What stops the LLM from accidentally (or deliberately, for achieving the goal) adding facts or rules that are unsound (both logically and from a real-world perspective)?<p>The paper reports a *51%* false positive rate on a logic benchmark! That’s shockingly high, and suggests the LLM is either bad at logical models or keeps creating unsoundnesses. Sadly, the evaluation is a bit thin on the ground about how this stacks up, and what causes it to fall short.",

It also sometimes introduces hallucinations, because parts of the context are with the assumption that eg tool results are there, but theyre not. Example Manus [0]. Eg, read file A, make changes on A. Then prompt on some more changes. If you now remove the &quot;read file A&quot; tool results, not only you break the cache, but in my own agent implementations(on gpt 5 at least) can hallucinate now since my prompt etc all naturally point to the content of the tool still beeing there.<p>Plus, the model got trained and RLed with a continuous context, except if they now tune it with messing with the context as well.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;manus.im&#x2F;blog&#x2F;Context-Engineering-for-AI-Agents-Lessons-from-Building-Manus\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;manus.im&#x2F;blog&#x2F;Context-Engineering-for-AI-Agents-Less...</a>",

I&#x27;d say that we invest most of our engineering effort into what is ultimately context management, such as:<p>1. Multi-agent orchestration\n2. Summarising and chunking large tool and agent responses\n3. Passing large context objects by reference between agents and tools<p>Two things to note that might be interesting to the community:<p>Firstly, when managing context, I recommend adding some evals to our context management flow, so you can measure effectiveness as you add improvements and changes.<p>For example, our evals will measure the impact of using Anthropics memory over time. Thus allowing our team to make a better informed decisions on that tools to use with our agents.<p>Secondly, there&#x27;s a tradeoff not mentioned in this article: speed vs. accuracy. Faster summarisation (or &#x27;compaction&#x27;) comes at a cost of accuracy. If you want good compaction, it can be slow. Depending on the use case, you should adjust your compaction strategy accordingly. For example, (forgive my major generalisation), for consumer facing products speed is usually preferred over a bump in accuracy. However, in business accuracy is generally preferred over speed.",
